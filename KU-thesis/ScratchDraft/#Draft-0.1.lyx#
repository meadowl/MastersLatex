Story begins with looking for overall abstractions between remote object
 systems and being curious as to seeing if adding an ordered lens-like structure
 was possible between multiple systems.
 Even if the abstraction is nothing more than a wrapper or boilerplate for
 existing code, it sparked my curiosity if these remote systems could stimulate
 or in fact provide the simplicity of lenses to an end user.
 And that these abstractions were representable of total systems in existence,
 due to their popularity with classical lenses.
 As well as the fact that several online server applications attempt to
 bring this boilerplate into their own code with different levels of effectivene
ss across their own systems.
 This led to some initial questions and concerns, mainly what a lens is,
 what a lens is in a programing language – specifically Haskell, and what
 are the existing standards for what constitutes the different categories
 of lenses that exist in the broad community.
 Keep in mind that Lenses are about solving a bijective dictionary problem,
 as so far as to provide convenience to the end user.
 Most commonly in the functional community lenses are abstractions that
 are popular to provide an object-oriented accessor notation to an object’s
 elements.
 In the sense that the functions that wrap data into record structures are
 able to be acted on by functions that unwrap or rewrap data in a convenient
 way.
 There are extensional ideas that relate to this such as Traversable structures
 and those should be representable as well.
 But that is not the primary focus of this research, although in the case
 of Remote Monad, the Traversable is very much implementable abet with some
 extra efforts.
 Lenses are in briefest summary a mathematical tool to manipulate dictionaries
 and nested dictionaries.
 They came as an expansion to the mostly solved bijective dictionary space
 and an attempt to further expand out the work with new levels of abstractions.
 Every lens has a set and a get function that it bundles together, and are
 molded after object-class accessors.
 And essentially accomplish the goal of retrieving or mutating values inside
 of those kinds of objects.
 As to what the community considers a well-behaved lens, this in itself
 can be varied and ends up becoming unclear based on who’s implementation
 and rationalization you read on.
 Much like much of computer science terms end up thrown around interchangeably,
 meanings are lost and altered for established words, and so therefore it
 becomes important to establish what each body of work considers to be a
 lens and a well-defined lens.
 For starters what separates well-defined from not? A well-defined function
 follows what are generally expected rules and results that the average
 user might expect.
 And a function that is not well-defined will possibly posses unexpected
 behaviors that the user doesn’t intend to occur.
 A clever way to imagine this is to imagine the standards in place for the
 C++ compiler.
 There are well-defined and expected results if one were to define a simple
 addition function.
 However, there are no defined results as to what should happen if your
 main function does not have a return statement embedded at the end.
 So in this way a well-defined lens has some expected behaviors that will
 always hold true if it follows a communities prescribed expectations.
 But unfortunately, the manual itself is ill-defined based on the source
 that you prescribe, therefore it is important that in this body of work
 the manual for a well-defined lens is included.
 So that it becomes possible to judge in this body of work if the lens fits
 what we wished from its behaviors.
 And ultimately anything that isn’t defined should be disregarded in the
 same way that one might disregard the C++ compilers handling of no return
 statement in main.
 We are ultimately concerned with defined behaviors as they relate to defined
 expectations.
 Speaking in layman’s terms: Get-Put Law: Putting back what you Get results
 in the same object.
 Put( Get (s ) s ) = s Put-Put Law: How one Put will Override a previous
 Put.
 Put( Put( a v) s ) = Put( a s) Put-Get Law: Getting back what you Put results
 in the new object.
 Get( Put( a s) ) = a Are usually what are discussed when referencing classical
 lens implementations in computing languages for well-defined behaviors.
 Removing laws or altering them varies based on sources of work read.
