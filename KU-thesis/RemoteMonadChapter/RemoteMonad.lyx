As has been established in the earlier chapter, covering the mathematical
 background and the historical Haskell programming context, this primary
 article will show both an introduction to remote lenses as well as their
 implementation with the 
\emph on
Remote Monad
\emph default
.
 As described the two primary components of both programmatic and mathematical
 lenses are the 
\emph on
Set
\emph default
 and 
\emph on
View 
\emph default
which produce as a result of applying them both at the same time a command
 referenced as 
\emph on
Over
\emph default
.
 Which now allows us to describe a variation that copies on the structure
 and intent of these operators over a remote connection between a client
 and a host device, the host running Haskell and the client running some
 other language.
 This variation which is the main subject of study of this paper will be
 referred to as the 
\emph on
Remote Lens
\emph default
 and will be fleshed out starting now and until the end of this manuscript.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To start defining the individual components of 
\emph on
Remote Lenses
\emph default
, we must begin with an abstract type definition which will prove useful
 in guiding through more concrete implementations that will be brought forward
 later on:

\begin_layout Standard
The essentials of what is required is aptly similar to the definitions seen
 in the elementary Prelude construction of Haskell lenses.
 With that in mind, the first argument typically taken by any lens operator
 is a function that will access a deep rooted parameter inside of a structure.
 Along the same vein, the
\emph on
 Remote Lens
\emph default
 variant accomplishes the same with an abstraction of the 
\emph on
Remote Object's
\emph default
 nested fields that are to be queried into once the command is sent from
 host to client.
 The primary difference in how this is handled by Haskell, is that rather
 than simply pattern matching into the already existing structure â€” a completely
 different approach is needed instead.
 This will involve internally concatenating a conjointment of the parameter.
 Where each of the parameters that normally would be accessed with a composition
 of pattern matching functions, must instead be accessed with a composition
 of the 
\emph on
Remote Object's
\emph default
 internal parameters.
 It is a fair and equally valid to imagine representing the target object
 as a remote record with the means to access the contents completely dependent
 on how that record was implemented inside of the client's language.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another shared argument is the structure that will be accessed by the lens
 operator.
 Similarly, what is passed around in the 
\emph on
Remote Lens
\emph default
 is a reference to the location of what is be accessed upon sending the
 constructed command.
 Which is why directly accessing the information is not possible, since
 one is manipulating only a reference to the actual object in the client's
 side.
 And that the careful composition method mentioned in the former paragraph
 was needed.
 As bundling the reference to the 
\emph on
Remote Object
\emph default
 along with the preformed command to operate on the 
\emph on
Remote Object
\emph default
 are absolutely necessary, otherwise none of the methods to view or alter
 the contents of that structure are at all possible to create.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The final shared parameter is the return type from the result of applying
 the lens operator to the structure that one is inspecting.
 This is also represented by the 
\emph on
Remote Lens's
\emph default
 return type, where for a 
\noun on
RemoteView
\noun default
 the return type will be the desired queried item wrapped in the remote
 operator that allowed for the operation to take place and for 
\noun on
RemoteSet
\noun default
/
\noun on
RemoteOver
\noun default
 the return type will be the reference to the altered structure wrapped
 up in the same remote operator.
 The only major consideration when manipulating the returned structure,
 is that one must assign the type of the expected viewed parameter or trust
 that there is sufficient information that Haskell can self-interpret the
 type for itself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now it becomes possible to introduce the primary example that this manuscript
 will cover, specifically the 
\emph on
Remote Lens
\emph default
 as it relates to the 
\emph on
Remote Monad 
\emph default

These are the types for the set of functions that seek to emulate the methods
 of 
\emph on
View
\emph default
, 
\emph on
Set
\emph default
, and 
\emph on
Over
\emph default
 that have been instantiated specifically for a 
\emph on
Remote Lens
\emph default
 based on using the 
\emph on
Remote Monad
\emph default
.
 Despite that they do not share the same internal structure of their locally
 implemented counterparts, that in their behavior they will accomplish the
 same goal, which is to resolve standard dictionary manipulation.
 This wrapper style may not have been used by others, but it is specifically
 implemented to show that it can be viewed as a universal design pattern.
 Rather an attempt to show that for any client host system in which there
 is a an interaction between a host language, client language, and a remote
 structure â€” that a fully formed method of communicating between the two
 is presentable in this way.

Such that as in the abstract syntax that: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Set2 ( View2 (s ) s ) = s 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Set2( Set2( a v) s ) = Put( a s) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
View2( Set2( a s) ) = a 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Is a similar result, however it is worth noting, that due to the fact that
 we are dealing with a remote connection that the connection must be passed
 around â€“ in addition to the object you want to manipulate, where inside
 the object you wish to lens to, and a value if using the Put function.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now, one more important thing to note, is while in Haskell you normally
 are manipulating and creating new objects every time you run a function
 or assign it to a value.
 When manipulating Javascript, you are never creating a new object on the
 other side.
 So, any code youâ€™d want to write with these methods on the Haskell-side,
 would need to keep in mind that you never are dealing with a fresh object.
 The connection will always make sure you are pointing to the one and only
 original Javascript object you are trying to manipulate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A key distinction on the improvements is that this removes any sort of backend
 coding, where the user is directly manipulating the delicate remote monad
 commands.
 And instead has a predefined way of accessing, editing, and setting values
 with minimal contact to the ideas and command structure beneath.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So much like lenses were used to re-solve the local dictionary problem.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Remote lenses here are used to re-solve the remote dictionary problem.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And this is a clear method that shows how it can be solved.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You get abstraction and type safety on every component of the command, and
 modularity that clearly expresses your intent to the reader of your code.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Example:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With basic syntactical sugar, with view2 as ^.
 And composition of remote lens fields as >>> â€¦ you get a clear expression
 that shows to anyone else on your coding team what you were doing.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
lstparams "language=Haskell"
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

f :: Double <- person ^.
 nest >>> nest2 >>> extra3
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
f :: Double <- person ^.
 nest >>> nest2 >>> extra3
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Where for the remote-object of person, I am accessing 2 layers into itâ€™s
 fields to retrieve a double value from extra3.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The normal syntax for this would be represented as:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
Set_{2}\left(View_{2}\left(s\right)\:s\right)=s
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
view2 (extra3(nest2(nest))) person
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Which expands out to in the weeds as: â€”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
g <- constructor $ JavaScript $ pack $ (extra3(nest2(nest))) (var_text person)
 procedure $ var g 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Repeat this for Set, Over, and for the examples of Lens Laws? (Yes)
